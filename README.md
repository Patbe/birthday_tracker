<h1><strong>Birthday Tracker App</strong></h1>

This is a python script that creates a simple desktop app that allows the user to type in birhdays of friends, familiy to get a reminder who has birthday next.

<a href='./bd2.py'>Link to the script</a>

I created this project to always remember who's birthday is next so I won't forget any. However, I would just use it to save nicknames since the data is not encrypted.

The user is able to add the name and birthday of a person, after opening the app again the person who has birthday next is shown (birthday, name, how many days left).
Currently the app is in German.

The Data is saved and retrieved via a SQLite Database, the user interface is created with Tkinter.

This script could be improved by:
- Add encryption
- Add function to delete data or to view database without having to use a database browser
