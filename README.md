<h1><strong>Birthday Tracker App</strong></h1>

This is a python script that creates a simple desktop app that allows the user to type in birthdays of friends, familiy to get a reminder who has birthday next.

<a href='./bd2.py'>Link to the script</a>

I created this project always to remember who's birthday is next so I won't forget any. However, I would save nicknames since the data is not encrypted.

The user is able to add the name and birthday of a person. After opening the App again, the person who has a birthday next is shown (birthday, name, how many days left).
Currently, the App is in German.

The Data is saved and retrieved via an SQLite Database, and the user interface is created with Tkinter.

This script could be improved by:
- Add encryption
- Add function to delete data or to view the database in the App without having to use a database browser
